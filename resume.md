But if you want to hear me tell my story, this is what I would tell a new friend in a bar. This is what I am calling my Honest Resumeâ„¢  



<details><summary><b>2005-2010: Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras</b></summary>
<br/>
<p>
Purely owing to my skill in arithmetic, I got into IIT Madras, (which is a prestigious engineering school in India), specifically the dual degree program in Electrical Engineering where you complete both Bachelors and Masters degrees in 5 years.

Once in, I realized that beating the competition and getting into an IIT was my only goal until that point and I hadn't really thought about why I even wanted to be an engineer. And the new-found freedom which college offers was too hard to resist. And so basically skimmed through my five years, not coming close to flunking and nowhere near excellence.

<details><summary><b>2011-2014: Risk Analyst for Citi</b></summary>
<br/>
<p>
I basically took the first job I could find out of college, working for CitiBank through a consulting firm (TCS). I started working for their Risk Analytics division as a developer building and maintaining their internal Microsoft Sharepoint website.

Despite lacklustre education, I still had some intrinsic skills, I was good at math and I enjoyed coding and building things.
