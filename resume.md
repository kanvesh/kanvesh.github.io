<details><summary><b>2005-2010: Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras</b></summary>
<br/>
<p>
Purely owing to my skill in arithmetic, I got into IIT Madras, (which is a prestigious engineering school in India), specifically the dual degree program in Electrical Engineering where you complete both Bachelors and Masters degrees in 5 years.

Once in, I realized that beating the competition and getting into an IIT was my only goal until that point and I hadn't really thought about why I even wanted to be an engineer. And the new-found freedom which college offers was too hard to resist. And so basically skimmed through my five years, not coming close to flunking and nowhere near excellence.
