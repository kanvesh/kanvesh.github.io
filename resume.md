But if you want to hear me tell my story, this is what I would tell a new friend in a bar. This is what I am calling my Honest Resumeâ„¢  



<details><summary><b>2005-2010: Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras (5 Years)</b></summary>
<br/>
<p>
Purely owing to my skill in arithmetic, I got into IIT Madras, (which is a prestigious engineering school in India), specifically the dual degree program in Electrical Engineering where you complete both Bachelors and Masters degrees in 5 years.

Once in, I realized that beating the competition and getting into an IIT was my only goal until that point and I hadn't really thought about why I even wanted to be an engineer. And the new-found freedom which college offers was too hard to resist. And so basically skimmed through my five years, not coming close to flunking and nowhere near excellence.

<details><summary><b>2011-2014: Risk Analyst for Citi (3 Years)</b></summary>
<br/>
<p>
I basically took the first job I could find out of college, working for CitiBank through a consulting firm (TCS). I started working for their Risk Analytics group as a the lone developer building and maintaining their internal Microsoft Sharepoint website, and make it work on Internet Explorer 6 (ancient even back then, but then banks are like that). I did my job and people were happy with it, but I really had no hope of making it as a developer

But the core function of the group, credit risk modeling, was something I was really drawn to during this time. Numbers and probability, it felt right up my alley. So, I read some books  on modeling and talked to people to somehow make the switch into the modeling team, but no avail. Banks are fairly rigid and it is hard to cut through teams.

So I started looking out

Despite lacklustre education, I still had some intrinsic skills, I was good at math and I enjoyed coding and building things.
