Americans are amused at this to no end, but the original format of cricket, the Test Match, runs for a full 5 days. These long matches however, are seeing a slow decline over time, and the sport in recent times been dominated by shorter formats, but the 5-day Test still remains the highest echelon for greatness in cricket. I myself like Test Cricket over all other formats, but I have to admit that I simply don't have the patience to watch a game slowly unfold over 5 days. Is there a way to make the viewing experience more fun and crisp? I give it a shot using a simple VGG Image Classifier here.
