*I have taken inspiration from [Joe Hovde](https://www.residualthoughts.com/about/) and decided to restart this blog more like a journal than fully-rounded articles. So bear with me.*

For a long time, I thought sarcasm was the ultimate test for an intelligent machine. You need to get some many things like context, references and timing to make a witty remark. We are now officially there. Chatgpt is pretty good at sarcasm. Some examples for you.

There are hits and misses, but 6) was a pretty good one and 7) had context (Delhi being famous for its smog). I did see fair many during my research that made me laugh out loud.

So I thought why don't we have a website/twitter account which gives news along with a cynical comment, saving you from the effort of rolling your eyes too many items. I loved the idea and went about asking chatgpt to find and filter the extra funny ones. But this is where it gets tricky. When specifically asked for funny headlines, it seems to fail.

**Not really self-aware I guess**

These ones somehow just seem to miss the mark, as if its trying hard to make joke but failing badly.

**Settled on a twitter bot**

After trying hard to get chatgpt to find a balance, I gave up and thought- screw it, we'll make it a bot with what we got. So I went to pythonanywhere.com, copy pasted a bunch of code, all generated by chatgpt, did a lot of admin work getting a twitter account and all the security stuff around posting to it, and now I have this twitter handle [Punny news bot](https://x.com/punnybotme) up and running. There is a daily job that posts a bunch of tweets.

That's it folks. If you found it interesting, please give the twitter account a follow and give your feedback.
Adios!
