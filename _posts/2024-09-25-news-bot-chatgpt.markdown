I have taken inspiration from [Joe Hovde](https://www.residualthoughts.com/about/) and decided to restart this blog more like a journal than like fully-rounded articles. So bear with me.

For a long time, I thought sarcasm was the ultimate test for an intelligent machine. You need to get some many things like context, references and timing to make a witty remark. We are now officially there. Chatgpt is amazing at sarcasm. Some examles for you.

I asked chatgpt to make jokes about headlines.

There are hits and misses, but 6) was a pretty good one and 7) had context (Delhi being famous for its smog). I did see fair many that I laughed out loud.

But this is where it gets tricky. It does not seem to understand how funny its own jokes are.

These ones somehow just seem to miss the mark
