I have taken inspiration from [Joe Hovde](https://www.residualthoughts.com/about/) and decided to restart this blog more like a journal than like fully-rounded articles. So bear with me.


For a long time, I thought sarcasm was the ultimate test for an intelligent machine. You need to get some many things like context, references and timing to make a witty remark. We are now officially there. Chatgpt is amazing at sarcasm. Some examles for you.

There are hits and misses, but 6) was a pretty good one and 7) had context (Delhi being famous for its smog). I did see fair many during my research that I laughed out loud.

But this is where it gets tricky. When specifically asked for funny headlines, it seems to fail.

These ones somehow just seem to miss the mark, as if its trying hard to make joke but failing badly.

After trying hard to get chatgpt to find a balance, I gave up and screw it, we'll make it a bot with what we got. So I went to pythonanywhere.com, copy pasted a bunch of code all generated by chatgpt, did a lot of admin work getting a twitter account and all the security stuff around posting to it, and now I have this twitter handle [Punny news bot](https://x.com/punnybotme) up and running. There is a daily job that posts a bunch of tweets.

That's it folks. If you found it interesting, send me a message on twitter(https://x.com/decentgrad) or email me.
Adios!
